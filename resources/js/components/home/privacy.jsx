<strong>(ii)</strong> after receiving your request, where technically feasible, we will transmit your personal data directly to another data holder.</p>
<p><strong>(d) Commercially sensitive information</strong></p>
<p>Where providing you access to your Personal Data would reveal commercially sensitive information, we are unable to give you access to that information. However, we will provide you with the reasoning behind our determination.</p>

<p>Where we cannot directly provide you with access to your Personal Data we may, if it is reasonable, engage the services of an intermediary to do so.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that the information you provide to us is accurate and to update your Personal Data as necessary. If for any reason you are unable to correct any Personal Data held by us, please contact us using the details provided in clause 1.1(b).</p>
<p>If after receiving your request we choose not to correct your information, we will notify you within one month of the reason of our refusal and the mechanisms available to you to object to our refusal.</p>
<p>If you wish to have your Personal Data erased, please communicate your request to us using the contact information provided in clause 1.1(b). The only circumstances in which we will not take reasonable steps to erase your Personal Data are where we need to keep it in accordance with another provision of this Privacy Statement, the GDPR, or for any other legal reason. However, our deleting of your Personal Data may result in the deletion of your Cupid Media account and will mean you are unable to access our services.</p>
<p>If we correct or erase Personal Data about you that we previously disclosed to a third party in accordance with our Privacy Statement, we will take reasonable steps to notify the third party of the correction or erasure and to request that they do the same.</p>
<p><strong>(g) Refusal to correct or erase</strong></p>

<p>You may request that we limit or restrict the manner in which we deal with and process your Personal Data, in which case we will only process your Personal Data: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims against us; or for the protection of the rights of another person.</p>
<p><strong>(i) Costs</strong></p>
<p>Access to, erasure and rectification of your Personal Data, including any communications related thereto, will generally be provided free of charge. </p>
<p>Where your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive in nature (particularly due to repetitiveness) we may charge you a reasonable fee for providing the information or communication, or taking the action requested. Where your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive in nature, we may also refuse your request.</p>
<p><strong>(j) Specific objection rights</strong></p>
<p>If it becomes necessary for us to process your Personal Data without your consent for reasons of:</p>
<p><strong>(i)</strong> performing a task in the public interest;<br />
<strong>(ii)</strong> the exercise of an official authority that has been vested in us; or<br />

<p>you will have the right to object to such use.</p>
<p>If you object to our use of your Personal Data we will refrain from using your Personal Data unless compelling legitimate grounds exist for us to use that Personal Data, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
